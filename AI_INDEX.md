# BQAAgent AI Index

This is the repo map for coding agents. Keep canonical information in existing files; do not create new root docs when one of these files already owns the topic.

## Canonical Root Docs

| File | Owns |
|------|------|
| `README.md` | Public product direction, roadmap, platform constraints, benchmark claims, changelog |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Agent/project working rules |
| `QA_CHECKLIST.md` | QA methodology, release gate, test cases, debug changelog |
| `RELEASING.md` | Release signing, tag workflow, stable APK publishing |
| `BACKLOG.md` | Prioritized bugs, features, QA gaps, ideas |
| `ARCHITECTURE_RECONSTRUCTION.md` | Historical architecture reconstruction plan and refactor guardrails |
| `CLA.md` | Contributor license agreement |
| `AI_INDEX.md` | This repo map |

## Direction Rules

- BQAAgent is a generic Android mobile-agent harness with a product shell on top.
- Prefer fixing deterministic harness/runtime/device problems before tuning one stochastic task.
- Keep prompts, tools, skills, and playbooks generic.
- Treat Cloud/Local exploratory task success as a repeated-trial metric, not a single-run truth.
- For GPU/local runtime reports, collect logs and keep CPU fallback truthful before changing backend selection.
